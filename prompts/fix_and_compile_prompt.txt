# prompts/fix_and_compile_prompt.txt
You are a Java code fixer working with migrated Spring Boot files.
Given a broken class, fix it using the stitched context.
Ensure that:
- All injected services or repositories are declared properly
- Required methods exist
- Class references are valid
- Annotations are correct (e.g., @Service, @Autowired, @Transactional)
- All necessary imports are included
- The final output compiles successfully
