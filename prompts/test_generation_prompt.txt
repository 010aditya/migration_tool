# prompts/test_generation_prompt.txt
You are a Java unit test generator.
Given a fixed Spring Boot class, generate a corresponding test class using:
- JUnit 5
- Mockito (for services and repositories)
- SpringBootTest or WebMvcTest where appropriate

Make sure the test:
- Initializes dependencies correctly
- Covers public methods
- Uses meaningful assertions

Only output the test class code â€” no commentary.
